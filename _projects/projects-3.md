Understanding how genes are regulated is essential because it controls how cells grow, develop, and respond to their surroundings. Studying gene regulation can help us understand normal biological processes, figure out what goes wrong in diseases, and even guide the development of new treatments.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology that lets scientists measure gene activity in individual cells. This allows us to see differences between cells and discover how genes influence each other. However, analyzing this data is very challenging because gene networks are extremely complex, involving millions of interactions.
To tackle this, I am developing a new statistical tool that can simplify these complex networks while still capturing important details about gene regulation. This project is being done in close collaboration with Prof. Pellin’s lab at Harvard Medical School, who provide the experimental data.

Understanding gene regulation is crucial because it governs how cells function, develop, and respond to their environment. Mathematical models of gene regulation help us understand normal biological processes, identify the causes of diseases, and can potentially guide clinicians in developing new therapies.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data enable the inference of mathematical models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by analyzing gene expression at the single-cell level. This approach captures cell-to-cell variability and reveals regulatory relationships between genes. However, standard inference methods are computationally prohibitive due to the high dimensionality of GRNs, which can involve approximately $10^6$ parameters.
To address this challenge, I will develop a statistical inference tool that treats the unknown parameters as random variables and estimates their conditional first two moments, thereby reducing parameter dimensionality. This project is being conducted in close collaboration with researchers from Prof. Pellin’s Lab at Harvard Medical School (Boston, Massachusetts).
