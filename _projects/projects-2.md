Antimicrobial resistance, where bacteria stop responding to antibiotics, is becoming a serious global problem and could become the leading cause of death by 2050, even more than cancer.
New bioelectrical technologies allow scientists to watch bacteria grow in real time and see how they respond to different conditions, like varying doses of antibiotics or different amounts of nutrients.
In this project, I am developing new mathematical models to understand how bacteria grow and react to antibiotics. The models will be carefully adjusted to match experimental data, even when the measurements are noisy or imperfect.
The insights from this work will help us better understand how antibiotic resistance develops and could guide the creation of safer and more effective antibiotics. This project is done in close collaboration with Prof. Asally’s lab at the University of Warwick, who provide the experimental data.

Antimicrobial resistance is an escalating global threat, predicted to become the leading cause of death, surpassing cancer, by 2050. Recently developed bioelectrical technologies for live-cell detection and antibiotic susceptibility testing provide longitudinal measurements of bacterial growth under varying experimental conditions, such as antibiotic concentration and nutrient availability.
This project aims to elucidate the mechanisms of bacterial growth response by calibrating a family of growth models to these experimental data while accounting for measurement noise arising from technological artifacts. Model parameters will be estimated using novel inference methods that I am developing.
The results of this work will contribute to a deeper understanding of antimicrobial resistance dynamics and support the development of safer and more effective antibiotics. This project is conducted in close collaboration with researchers from Prof. Asally’s lab at the School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick (UK), who generate the experimental datasets.
