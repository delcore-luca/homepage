Clonal haematopoiesis (CH) happens when certain blood stem cells acquire mutations and begin to grow faster than others. We still don’t fully understand what causes this process or how it eventually leads to cancer.
Current mathematical tools used to study CH have important gaps — they often ignore measurement errors, missing data, and the possibility that clonal growth may change in complex, nonlinear ways over time.
To tackle these challenges, I am developing a new mathematical model that can more accurately track how mutated cell populations grow, even when the data are noisy or incomplete. I am working closely with researchers in Prof. Huls’ lab at the University Medical Center Groningen, who will provide the experimental data for this project.
The results will help scientists design better experiments to study CH and may improve early detection of cancer risk in the future.

Clonal expansion of mutated haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is known as clonal haematopoiesis (CH). However, the molecular mechanisms driving CH, and those that precede tumour development, remain poorly understood. Existing mathematical models of CH typically overlook technical confounders, missing measurements, and the potential for nonlinear clonal dynamics.

To address these limitations, I am developing a latent-state nonlinear mixed-effects logistic model to infer CH dynamics from variant allele frequency data, explicitly accounting for heteroscedastic measurement error. This project is being carried out in close collaboration with researchers from Prof. Huls’ lab at the University Medical Center Groningen (Netherlands), who will provide the experimental datasets.

The insights gained from this work will support the optimal design of experiments in safety studies of clonal haematopoiesis and enable more effective future clonal screenings, ultimately contributing to earlier prediction of tumour development.
