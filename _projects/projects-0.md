Mathematical models of rabbit heart cells, called Purkinje fibers, can help predict how drugs affect the heart’s electrical activity. However, these models don’t always match experimental observations. This can happen if the model itself is oversimplified or if the parameters used in the model are not optimal — or sometimes both.
In this project, I am developing a statistical framework to fine-tune these models so they better match experimental data. This includes measurements of electrical activity in rabbit Purkinje fibers as well as how different drugs affect specific ion channels in the cells. The framework uses a method that adjusts the model parameters to minimize differences between predictions and actual experiments.
This work is done in collaboration with Sanofi (Frankfurt, Germany) and Prof. Gary Mirams at the University of Nottingham (UK). The results will help improve drug safety assessments and regulatory decisions, and also advance the use of mathematical and statistical methods for studying complex biological systems.

Mathematical action potential (AP) models of rabbit Purkinje fibers, combined with ion channel screening data, can be used to predict drug-induced changes in AP. However, these models sometimes fail to reproduce experimental observations. Such discrepancies may arise from model misspecification, suboptimal parameter choices, or a combination of both.
The aim of this work is to develop a statistical framework to calibrate the parameters of various mathematical AP models, enabling them to fit experimental control AP traces collected from rabbit Purkinje fibers, alongside orthogonal ion channel inhibition data obtained under a set of reference drug compounds. The proposed framework employs a maximum likelihood approach that minimizes the distance between model predictions and experimental data.
This project is conducted in collaboration with Sanofi (Frankfurt, Germany) and Prof. Gary Mirams at the University of Nottingham (UK). The outcomes of this work have implications not only for drug safety and regulatory decision-making but also for advancing inverse modeling and computational statistics in high-dimensional dynamical systems.
