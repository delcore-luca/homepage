Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course Contemporary Statistics with Applications for academic years 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Description
======

This course unit introduces a range of contemporary statistical modeling techniques for data analysis. Each method will be motivated through practical applications or real data examples, followed by an explanation of the underlying theoretical principles. Through hands-on exercises, students will apply these methods to real-world datasets in R and interpret the results. Topics covered in the course include: penalized linear regression models (e.g., Ridge and Lasso regression), linear classification techniques (e.g., LDA), principal component analysis (PCA), Gaussian and other mixture models, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, cubic splines and Gaussian Process regression, bootstrap methods and permutation tests, and hidden Markov models (HMMs).
