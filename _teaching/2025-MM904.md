Teaching Financial Stochastic Processes for the academic year 2025/26.

Description
======

This course introduces the mathematical modeling of financial markets using stochastic processes, focusing on both discrete and continuous frameworks. It covers basic concepts and assumptions in finance, including risk-free and risky assets, expected returns, portfolio construction, and the principles of no-arbitrage, along with definitions of financial derivatives such as forwards, calls, and puts, including the distinction between European and American types. We will explore the Binomial tree model, beginning with one-step models for risky assets and option pricing through replication. Topics include risk-neutral probabilities, multi-step models with backward induction, martingale properties, the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein formula, put-call parity, and pricing strategies for American derivatives. Finally, continuous-time models are introduced, including the Black-Scholes formula, Ito’s calculus, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and the Greeks for measuring sensitivities of derivative prices, with extensions to other SDE-based models.
